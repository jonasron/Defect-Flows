# Defect-Flows
Code and data for the articles "Flow around topological defects in active nematic films".
The defects.py is a finite ellement solver for the stockes equation.
The Spatially-varying activity.py is an updated code that allows for higher order defects, gradients in the activity and arbitrary background nematic orientation.
The folders vorticityfields and velocityfields contains some vorticity and velocity fields, including those that are shown in figure 4. The ziped folders contains the 
largest systems scince these were to large to uplode to github without compressing them. 
The text files in the last folder is used to create figure 6.
